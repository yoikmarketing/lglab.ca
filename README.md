We both should follow this pattern for work. It will allow us to work on our own schedule whenever we are available, while still being on top of what each other are doing and lets us hold each other accountable for our work with reviews.

1. Look at the issues list, pick something you want to do and assign yourself to it.

> *Assigning ourselves to issues lets us know what the other member is working on*

3. Make a new branch named `issue-X` where `X` is replaced by the issue number. Do your work in that branch.

> *Unique branch names corresponding to issues keeps things clean because each issue directly represents a task to complete, and each branch should be unique to one task*

5. Push your work and create a pull request. Link the issue you're working on to the pull request so they close together.

> *The pull request understandably is to cleanly merge changes into the main branch. Linking the issue allows it to automatically be closed when the pull request is merged; just saves some time*

7. Request review from peer, wait for review, then merge!

> *You can review my work and I'll review yours to make sure everything is looking good!*

After review, or even while waiting for review, you can go and pick a new issue, make a new branch and continue working!
