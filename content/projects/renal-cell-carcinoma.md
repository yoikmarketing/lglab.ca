name: Renal Cell Carcinoma
description: >-
  Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) is one of the most common and lethal kinds of
  kidney cancer. Approximately, one-third of all patients present with
  metastases at initial diagnoses. Although RCC is known to elicit a strong host
  immune response, the cancer has been deemed resistant to both immunotherapy
  and chemotherapy treatments. Unraveling the genes which regulate metastasis of
  RCC and the mechanism(s) by which is evades the host immune system may lead to
  improved biomarkers which guide therapy or prognosis. The investigation using
  basic science could lead to therapies which could improve the overall survival
  of patients with RCC.



  Over 90% of RCC tumors from patients aberrantly express a cell surface glycoprotein known as Kidney Injury Molecule-1 (KIM-1) to varying extents. Our lab uses basic science and translational techniques to elucidate the pathophysiological role of KIM-1 in RCC, investigating both the role of KIM-1 in host immune evasion, as well as its role in metastasis.
