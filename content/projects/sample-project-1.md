name: Kidney Transplantation
description: Kidney transplantation is the optimal treatment for patients with
  kidney failure. However, the lifespan of transplanted kidneys is limited by
  several factors including the quality of the donor organ (e.g. age) and tissue
  damage sustained during the organ transplantation process. The major causes of
  tissue damage are from injury due to reduced blood flow and oxygen to the
  organ and the immune system (i.e. rejection response). When the organ is
  deprived of oxygen, this leads to the death of kidney cells and leakage of
  inflammatory contents from the dying cells into the surrounding tissue. Immune
  cells responding to these contents further propagate tissue damage and can
  even enhance the rejection process against the kidney. Our lab and others have
  characterized Kidney Injury Molecule (KIM-1) as a protein which aids in the
  rapid removal of dying cells and promoting repair after kidney injury. The
  role of KIM-1 in human transplantation is not well understood. Our project
  aims address this knowledge gap using a mouse model that mimics human kidney
  transplantation. Our work will uncover the detailed mechanisms underlying the
  role of KIM-1 in kidney injury and repair during transplantation, and may
  uncover new therapeutic strategies that enhance the lifespan of the
  transplanted kidneys.
