  Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a serious syndrome that encompasses a spectrum of
  disorders that lead to an abrupt decline in kidney function. AKI most often
  results from severe or prolonged hypo-perfusion (ischemia) or
  nephrotoxicant-induced injury. It affects about 5-10% of all hospitalized
  patients and is associated with increased mortality risk. Unfortunately, there
  has been no improvement in mortality rates with current therapies.


  AKI is characterized by tubular cell death and inflammation. The efficient removal of apoptotic cells by phagocytes is essential for resolution of inflammation and tissue repair. Phagocytes that ingest apoptotic cells actively suppress local inflammation while preventing the release of immunogenic contents from apoptotic cells that can undergo secondary necrosis. Kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) is cell-surface receptor for phosphatidylserine (PS), an “eat me” signal displayed on the surface of apoptotic cells and necrotic cells. KIM-1 is highly unregulated on proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTECs) after AKI and transforms surviving PTECs into phagocytes for clearance of apoptotic and necrotic cells.


  Our recent work proposed a protective role for KIM-1 in ischemic AKI. We showed that Kim-1-/- mice sustained more severe and prolonged kidney dysfunction, tissue damage and mortality after bilateral renal artery clamping AKI leads to systemic inflammation and distant organ injury. Whether the relationship between AKI and mortality is causal is unclear, but emerging experimental evidence suggests that AKI directly contributes to systemic inflammation and multi-organ (e.g. cardiac, lung, etc.…) dysfunction. An exciting question is whether systemic inflammation and/or distant effects caused by AKI directly contribute to the mortality observed clinically.
